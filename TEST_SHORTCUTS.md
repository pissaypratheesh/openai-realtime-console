# Testing Global Shortcuts

## Current Status
âœ… Electron app is running
âœ… Global shortcuts are registered successfully:
- Ctrl+L (clipboard paste)
- Ctrl+Shift+S (start/stop session)
- Ctrl+Shift+P (pause/resume voice)
- Ctrl+Shift+H (show/hide window)

## Issue
Global shortcuts are not working despite successful registration.

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. macOS Accessibility Permissions (Most Likely)
**Problem**: macOS requires special permissions for apps to register global shortcuts.

**Solution**: 
1. Go to **System Preferences** â†’ **Security & Privacy** â†’ **Privacy** â†’ **Accessibility**
2. Click the lock icon to make changes
3. Add **Electron** to the list of allowed apps
4. Restart the Electron app

### 2. Test Individual Shortcuts
Try each shortcut to see which ones work:

- **Ctrl+Shift+H**: Should show/hide the Electron window
- **Ctrl+L**: Should paste clipboard content to AI
- **Ctrl+Shift+S**: Should start/stop session
- **Ctrl+Shift+P**: Should pause/resume voice

### 3. Alternative Shortcuts
If Ctrl+L conflicts with other apps, try these alternatives:
- **Ctrl+Shift+L**: Less likely to conflict
- **Ctrl+Alt+L**: Alternative modifier combination
- **Ctrl+;**: Semicolon key (rarely used)

### 4. Debug Steps
1. Copy some text to clipboard
2. Press Ctrl+L from any app
3. Check if Electron window shows/focuses
4. Check terminal for console logs like "ðŸ”¥ Global Ctrl+L triggered!"

## Next Steps
1. Try Ctrl+Shift+H first (show/hide window) - this is least likely to conflict
2. If that works, the issue is with Ctrl+L specifically
3. If nothing works, check accessibility permissions
